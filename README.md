# Prosper_Loan_Data_Analysis
Prosper or Prosper Marketplace, is a leader in the online peer-to-peer lending industry. Borrowers create profiles and listings (request loans) on Prosper.com. Borrowers can apply for a fixed-rate - fixed-term loan between $2,000 and $40,000. Investors, either individuals or institutions, view the listing (borrower’s loan request) and decide how much to lend the borrower towards the loan.

Interest rates are typically lower for the borrower than going to a financial institution, such as a bank and multiple investors can contribute to one borrower’s loan request, limiting the overall risk impact of the borrower defaulting on the loan for any one investor and providing a higher yield.

The Prosper Loan dataset contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, borrower employment status, borrower credit history, and the latest payment information. The dataset was last updated on 03/11/2014.

As an amateur, I find the idea of peer-to-peer lending quite interesting from a borrower and an investor standpoint. Through this analysis, I would like to determine which conditions(variables) might determine Loan repayment of users.
